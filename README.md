# Advancing Mental Health AI through Synthetic Data Generation and Curriculum Training

## Overview

This project addresses the increasing demand for mental health support using advanced AI technology, focusing on:

1. Generating synthetic datasets for AI model training
2. Developing a context-aware AI model for efficient screening and support

## Background

- Rising number of mental health help seekers
- Limited availability of medical practitioners
- Need for efficient screening of distress candidates

## Challenges

1. Lack of large, diverse datasets
2. Developing AI models responsive to context-aware situations

## Our Solution

### Synthetic Dataset Generation
- Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4 and Nemotron models
- Validation from medical experts

### Context-Aware AI Model
- Curriculum-inspired AI summarizer model
- Extracts relevant diagnostic features from input text

## Methodology

1. Synthetic data generation
2. Real-world data collection from Reddit forums
3. Medical expert evaluation and annotation
4. Fine-tuning classifier and summarizer models
5. Comparative analysis of model performance

## Key Findings

- Fine-tuned models trained on merged datasets (synthetic + annotated) perform better
- Summarizer model improved classification accuracy by 5% for real-world data

## Impact

This project is a step towards developing an AI assistant to:
- Screen large volumes of submissions from distress individuals
- Facilitate connections between needy individuals and medical experts

## Resources

Models and pruned datasets are freely available for the research community.
