# PsychSynth-Advancing-Mental-Health-AI-Through-Synthetic-Data-Generation-and-Curriculum-Training
The number of Mental-health help seekers are on
rise over recent years, but the medical practitioners are limited
due to which the healthcare system is heavily loaded and
thereby the outcome is not promising. Advanced AI Technology
is expected to ease this problem, however completely relying on
the tools is reported to not work with the help seekers. Hence
technology to assist help seekers and allow the healthcare system
to screen the needy ones from the large pool of distress candidates
should make the system efficient and effective. However for
establishing the AI supportive system, two challenges exists: one
is the large pool of dataset with diversity, and other is the
AI model to respond to a context-aware situations. Expecting
large dataset for training model from medical community needs
further infrastructure support to make it digitally available with
embedded annotations. Relying patiently for the dataset will miss
the opportunity to serve the distress patients. Hence synthetic
dataset generation and its validation from medical experts is
an alternative for training robust and reliable model. Besides,
context-aware curriculum inspired AI based summarizer model
is found appropriate to adopt for this use-case where relevant
features meant for diagnosing the problem is extracted from the
improvised input text. The proposed curriculum trained AI model
helps in transforming the improvised text inputs fed from the
distress individuals to a summarized version representing domain
expert form, embedded with symptoms related features for
further classification. The synthetic data-set generation through
OpenAI’s GPT-4o models and Nemotron models are further
evaluated with BERT based classifier models and curriculum
based AI model. The training of the classifier models are
also evaluated for synthetic and real-world dataset, which was
scrapped from Reddit forum. Around 800 stream of real-world
posts were evaluated from the medical experts and their findings
related to sympotoms and annotations were employed to fine-
tune the classifier and summarizer model. It was found that the
fine-tuned models and training of BERT models from the merged
dataset composed of synthetic ones with the medical practitioners
annotated dataset were found to perform better than others. The
summarizer model fetching shorter version of domain expert
output enhanced the classification accuracy by 5% for the real-
world data. The effort is a step towards developing AI assistant
to screen large posts of submissions from distress individuals and
arrange for the necessary connects for the needy ones with the
medical experts. The models and pruned datasets are made freely
available for further usage to the researchers community.
